1. create project and add a Source Package called "shoppingcart"

2. Go into the project directory you just created and under scr replace the folder called "shoppingcart" with the one provided by me under the src folder.

3. Insure that the List.dat file provided by me is outside of the      src folder in the project you created. This is the applications data file.


4. Open prject in editor and run "SystemAPI.java"


5. You will be prompted to login or create a user. Some of the already created accounts are: 
Seller(Username: jake, Password: okay), 
Customer(Username: josh, Password:okay),
Customer(Username: lauren, Password:okay),
the password field is case sensitive and these only work if the List.dat file is in the right place

6. Otherwise feel free to create users and try it out for yourself
